Updates v1.2.3:

1. fix google AD showing issue.

2. use native splash screen for app open.

3. keep history unless press AC button.

4. update some packages.

SUM Calculator is not only a calculator which could do simple +-รรท math work, but also keeps all your inputs and results, count and sum of them. You can easily delete the expression you don't need by long press on it.
