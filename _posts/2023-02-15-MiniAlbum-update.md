Updates v1.2.3:

1. fix google AD showing issue.

2. fix permission issues on android 12+.

3. update some packages.

This is the first version of MiniAlbum app, and the first app I start with the way of personal developer. This app was developed by flutter, at first I want to use fade in and fade out effect, but maybe there is a picture cache bug result in the wrong picture showing sequence. I will try it again when the new flutter version released.
