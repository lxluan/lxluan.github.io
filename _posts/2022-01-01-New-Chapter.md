## 明者因时而变，知者随事而制

```
The wise change with time,
and the wise control with things.
```



## 学如弓弩，才如箭镞

```
Learning is like a crossbow,
and talent is like an arrow.
```



## 天行健，君子以自强不息

```
As Heaven keeps vigor through movement,
a gentleman should unremittingly practice self-improvement.
```



## 大学之道，在明明德，在亲民，在止于至善

```
What the Great Learning teaches,
is to illustrate illustrious virtue,
to renovate the people,
and to rest in the highest excellence.
```



## 苟日新，日日新，又日新

```
If you can in one day renovate yourself,
do so from day to day and let there be daily renovation.
```
